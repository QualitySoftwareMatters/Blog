So - now that we are on this journey together, one topic I want to tackle is what determines whether or not software is of high quality and why we would want to pursue it?

### What is Quality? ###
In a general sense, the dictionary defines quality as

* How good or bad something is
* A high level of value or excellence

The first definition is hard to determine unless one decides on a standard with which to compare.
Criteria is important.  For instance, one thing I learned about projects is that it is helpful to have a discussion with the stakeholders about what would determine a successful project.  The answers to this question then would be used as success criteria.  If the team met those criteria, then the project would be considered a success.  This could be that a certain time line was met for the delivery.  Or maybe a set of functionality being implemented was important.  Whatever was determined is what is the criteria that will be used to determine whether or not the project was good or bad.

So, what criteria can we use to judge a piece of software?  There are two kinds of quality that can be used to better answer that question.

* external quality - perceived integrity / external integrity
* internal quality - conceptual integrity / internal integrity
