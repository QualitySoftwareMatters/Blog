How well do you know your tools?  

Do you know all of the ins and outs of your particular language, platform, tools, and techniques?  Or do you only know those that you had to use for your latest project?  Or do you only understand the basic "hello world" features that you learned from reading a blog, listening to a podcast, or attending a conference session?

### Past Experience Isn't Enough ###

Well...I'm here to tell you that that just isn't enough.  

First, because we are constantly under pressure to deliver as quickly as possible, when you encounter new problems you haven't solved before, chances are that you will take the path of least resistance and hack something together.  Without knowledge of everything that is possible, you will cobble something together in a sub-optimal way or worse yet duplicate functionality that has already been provided.

The other alternative is that you end up spending time trying to research whether or not a feature is available, and if so, how to actually use that feature to solve your problem.  That's precious time that you really can't afford to waste with such tight time frames to deliver.   

And lastly, when your next interviewer asks you to rate yourself on a scale from 1-10 on your knowledge of a given tool or technology, you want to be able to say 10 with confidence.  Because chances are that they will dig further into your rating to validate whether or not you are really telling the truth.  And if you are found wanting, they might not be willing to trust the rest of your answers.

[Maybe add some point on standing out and becoming a person that others come to for advice.]

So, what do you do to enhance your tool belt?  Practice...

### Being a Passionate Programmer ###

This idea came from the book, [The Passionate Programmer: Creating a Remarkable Career in Software Development (Pragmatic Life)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356344/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934356344&linkCode=as2&tag=meinershagenf-20&linkId=PLOEYSUEMJZ53KR2) by Chad Fowler.

In it, he suggests that, 

> Our industry tends to practice on the job.

He then relates our craft to the art of playing music, and, 

> Musicians are paid to perform in publicâ€”not to practice. 

So why would we expect to do it differently in our profession.

### Practicing on the Job ###

It takes hours of practice in order to learn our craft and, unfortunately, too many are practicing on the job these days, because it is acceptable. You cannot learn everything that you ought to know as a software craftsman by merely writing code for production software. Focusing on certain aspects is needed in order to increase the quality and resilience of what we produce. 

One of the areas that musicians focus on developing is **physical/coordination** or focusing on fundamental technical aspects of playing an instrument. They do this by playing scales in all of the range of the instrument, building the muscles in their lips or gaining callouses in their fingers, practicing dynamics with their diaphragms, etc. They cannot always be playing nice sounding music - they have to play simple, focused, seemingly monotonous exercises to focus on these fundamentals.

How can a software craftsman do the same? They can focus on looking at the full range of functionality available to them within a certain language, platform, tool, or technique. And they can practice using them in private exercises known as code katas or personal projects. 

So, spend some time thinking about what tools you already know something about and start practicing coding in areas of that tool or technique that you are not familiar with.  Get to know what is available and practice the full range of motion.  You will be much more prepared the next time you need to use that toolset.
