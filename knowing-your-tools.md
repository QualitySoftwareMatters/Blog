How well do you know your tools?  

Do you know all of the nooks and crannies of their capabilities or do you just understand the basic "hello world" features that you learned from some blog/podcast?  Or do you only know those bits that you had to use for your latest project? 

This idea came from the book, **The Passionate Programmer** by Chad Fowler.

In it, he suggests that, 

> Our industry tends to practice on the job.

He then relates our craft to the art of playing music, and, 

> Musicians are paid to perform in publicâ€”not to practice. 

So why would we expect to do it differently in our profession.

It takes hours of practice in order to learn our craft and, unfortunately, too many are practicing on the job these days, because it is acceptable. You cannot learn everything that you ought to know as a software craftsman by merely writing code for production software. Focusing on certain aspects is needed in order to increase the quality and resilience of what we produce. 

One of the areas that musicians focus on developing is **physical/coordination** or focusing on fundamental technical aspects of playing an instrument. They do this by playing scales in all of the range of the instrument, building the muscles in their lips or gaining callouses in their fingers, practicing dynamics with their diaphragms, etc. They cannot always be playing nice sounding music - they have to play simple, focused, seemingly monotonous exercises to focus on these fundamentals.

How can a software craftsman do the same? They can focus on looking at the full range of functionality available to them within a certain language, platform, or tool. And they can practice using these tools in private exercises known as katas or personal projects. That is what I seek to do with this series.
