Welcome to my new blog on quality software matters.  This is a new home where I plan to focus on the matter of how to build quality software.  Hopefully, each week I will be able to deliver a post on some idea or question I have about the topic.

You may be asking yourself,

> Why is Todd starting a new blog?  

The short answer is that it helps me to clarify my own thinking.  Below is a quote I read in a book by Dr. Howard Hendricks that I think describes the process pretty well.

> “Thoughts untangle themselves over the lips and through the fingertips.”

Isn't it funny how the simple act of talking about an idea or writing it down helps to untangle and clarify it?  

My other aim is to share my opinions and ideas with you.  I hope that this will be a small contribution to the community from which I have learned so much.  As Bernard of Clairvaux once said,

> There are those who seek knowledge for the sake of knowledge; that is Curiosity.  There are those who seek knowledge to be known by others; that is Vanity.  There are those who seek knowledge in order to serve; that is Love.
