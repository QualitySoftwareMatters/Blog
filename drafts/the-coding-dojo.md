In [my post on "Being Prepared"](http://www.qualitysoftwarematters.com/2015/07/being-prepared.html), I wrote about the need for us to ***practice*** our craft in order to deliver high quality code.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of demands for our time working on projects that are under tight deadlines and supporting existing software in production.

One of the ways to escape the daily grind and focus on developing new skills is to participate in a ***coding dojo***.

## What is a Coding Dojo? ##

A coding dojo is a periodic meeting where developers practice the craft of coding together with the object of learning how to do it better.  Each session should have a clear objective or focus and any code produced is purely for practice and should not be leveraged for real production software.  It's this aspect of throw away code that allows coders to feel safe to experiment and possibly fail while obtaining a higher level of skill.

> In software we do our practicing on the job, and
thatâ€™s why we make mistakes on the job. We need
to find ways of splitting the practice from the profession.
We need practice sessions.

* Coders
* Together
* Code - writing code
* Learn - how to write code better; share tips and advice
* Practice
* Discuss design, testing, refactoring, tools, etc.

## Safe Environment ##
Intro / moderation

* Should managers be there?
* Away from production bugs and deadline pressure
* It's okay to ask questions
* It's okay to not know how to do something (experiment)
* It's okay to try something and it not work
* Come away feeling positive about the experience and learning
* Opportunity to show off skills in coding

## Retrospective/Reflection ##
* Reflect on what you learn
* 1-2 items that you can act on going forward

## Feedback/Testing ##
* Tests provide feedback to make sure code works as expected

## Show working ##
* Process over product - Demonstrate how you write code not just the final code.
* Ensures that you learn a mechanism for writing good code not just what good code looks like.
* Can you learn just by reviewing someone else's code?

## How often? ##
* Context-driven = up to the group

## Content ##
* Discuss in future post
* Context-driven = based on group's desires and needs
