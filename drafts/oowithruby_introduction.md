I have been on vacation for the last week, and I decided to read a book by Sandi Metz called ["Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby - An Agile Primer"](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404882955&sr=8-1&keywords=sandi+metz).  I had read on Amazon that it was a fantastic book that had a lot of great object-oriented principles for any language regardless of the fact that it was using Ruby.  (Although, the fact that I could learn about Ruby along the way was a plus for me!)



I was blown away by the first few chapters.  Sandi has an incredible way of logically moving through the material, and she comes to some interesting conclusions about how to make code resilient to change.  In the next few posts, I want to share some of the insights that I gained from Chapters 2 and 3.

Hopefully, by the end of completing those posts, I will have read more of the book, and I can continue to share with you further chapters.  I am particularly interested in the last chapter concerning the ability to make tests resilient to change.

Hope it helps...
