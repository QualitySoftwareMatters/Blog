Does your team use sketching to aid in the design of your application?

The [Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) states,

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> * **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> * **Responding to change** over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

[Twelve Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

* The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.

## Abstraction over Notation ##
