There are numerous reasons to integrate with an existing external service outside of the boundaries of your team's ownership.  

Maybe you need to get an application up in a hurry and you only want to focus on the core functionality that only your business can provide.  Or maybe you have decided that it is cheaper to pay for a service than it is to implement it internally.  And maybe you just want to be a good corporate citizen and reuse existing functionality in the enterprise.

This service could be maintained by another team in your organization or it could be an outside, third party service maintained by a vendor.  In any case, it is important to think about what it takes.  

### Audit Your Interactions ###
No matter whether you are dealing with an external 3rd party producer or another application team within the same organization, once a different team owns a set of functionality/service that you want to consume, you will need to audit any of your communications.  This is to ensure that any issues that occur during production or in testing can be easily triaged.  Without a record of what you have sent or received from that party, it is hard to understand why things may have occurred.

Now - some will say that it isn't necessary to do this with your brothers and sisters in the same organization, but from my experience, anytime another group owns functionality, different priorities take place.  If that particular group is busy, they won't necessarily want to work on any issues unless you can prove that something wrong has occurred.

That includes both requests made to the party and responses that are received from the party.
