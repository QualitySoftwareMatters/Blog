There are numerous reasons to integrate with an existing external service outside of the boundaries of your team's ownership.  

Maybe you need to get an application up in a hurry and you only want to focus on the core functionality that only your business can provide.  Or maybe you have decided that it is cheaper to pay for a service than it is to implement it internally.  And maybe you just want to be a good corporate citizen and reuse existing functionality in the enterprise.

This service could be maintained by another team in your organization or it could be an outside, third party service maintained by a vendor.  In any case, it is important to think about what it takes.
